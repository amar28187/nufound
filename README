This is NuFound, a revision of the libFoundation library for use with Nu.


ABOUT

Forked mainly for expedience, NuFound contains a few bug fixes and 
enhancements that make NuFound look more like the Apple Foundation classes.
But there are many missing features, so in the future, one or more of
the following may happen, in no particular order of preference:

1. the GNUstep base library will be updated for use with Nu instead of NuFound.

2. the Cocotron project will be updated so that it can be built and used
with the "stock" GCC and libobjc on Linux.

3. NuFound will remerge into a revived libFoundation project.

4. a mature corporate Foundation library will be released under an acceptable
open source license.

5. NuFound will continue to be enhanced until it satisfies all requirements.


LICENSE

NuFound is released under the Apache Public License, v. 2.0.
libFoundation is available under a more liberal original license.
